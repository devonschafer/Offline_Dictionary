# Offline_Dictionary
Simple, useful way to implement a dictionary into your project.
I will be updating this, some words do not have definitions yet.
This collection has a total of 58,110 English words.
I will be uploading this as a few different data types for Python >= 3.5, and also as .txt document.

I created this because I was looking for a usable offline dictionary and could'nt find one that wasn't a PDF or paragraph form.
Hopefully someone finds this useful. 
The file by itself is about 9.5 MB.
